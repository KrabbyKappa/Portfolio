            <p>The Italian National Day is the most significant diplomatic event of the year, celebrating the birth of the Italian Republic. The 2025 edition in Kuala Lumpur continued this tradition of excellence, hosting high-level dignitaries, government officials, and business leaders in a celebration of Italian heritage. Serving as the Project Manager and Executive for this flagship event, I acted as the primary liaison between the Embassy and key stakeholders, including sponsors, event agencies, and the Mandarin Oriental hotel. I strategically planned the event layout to ensure appropriate protocol for ambassadors and local political entities, managed complex diplomatic settings, and instructed Embassy staff on their specific operational duties to guarantee a flawless execution.</p>
